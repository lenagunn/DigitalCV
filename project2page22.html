            <p>
                I attended Fairfield Warde High School where I graduated with honors and a GPA of 3.75. 
                In high school I was a member of the girls varisty soccer team. I was also in the Stampede Club which was our student varsity fan club. 
                In this club we made plans to get students out to different sporting events to support their classmates.
                Another club that I was involved in was Random Acts of Kindness. In this club we would plan and recognize different acts of kindness in our school community. 
                I recieved the Varsity Soccer Athletic Award my Senior Year of high school. 
                
            <br>
            <br>

            I know am attending Elon University wehere I am a sophomore, studying Strategic Communications and Media Analytics. 
            Next semester I hope to be spending my time in Charlotte, North Carolina. Where I will be taking classes and working on an internship.
            The past 3 semesters that I have spent at Elon I ended them all on the Deans list and with a cumulative GPA of 3.66.

        <div class="schools"><h1>Course Work</h1> 
            <p> Through my many classes and time at Elon I have gained many differnet skills throughout my course work. 
                Some of the more notable courses that I took where I gained great skills were Marketing, Strategic Writing and Understanding Audiences. 
                <h3>Marketing</h3> <p> In my marketing class I was assgined to work with a group to create a diligant, functioning 
                    marketing plan for a company. We had to work dierectly with the company and by having weekly meetings. One of our main goals for this project was to make sure the clients needs were met. 
                    This project gave me a look of what the working world looks like. 
                    <br>
                    <h3>Strategic Writing </h3>
                    <p> In my strategic writing class I have learned the differnt styles of writing that I could be doing in my furture career. 
                        Throughout this course I have learned that I really enjoy writing Press Releases and Futrure articles. 
                        This class also taught me the imporatnce of being 100% accurate when it comes to grammar and writing in AP style.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Understanding Audiences </h3>
                    <p> 
                        Understanding Audeinces is the first class that I took for my Media Analytics major. This class has been my favorite class that I have taken 
                        at Elon so far. We have learned how to use Excel, Google Sheets and Data Wrapper. I did not think I was going to enjoy making differnt graphs and charts as much as I do. 
                        This class has taught me how important analytics are in terms of websites, sports, entertainment, etc. 
                        I am excited to take other classes that will expand on my knowledge that I learned in this class.
